"use strict";
var firstName = "Peter", lastName = "Ally";
function showFullName() {
  console.log(this.firstName+" "+this.lastName);
};

var person = {
   firstName   :"Penelope",
   lastName    :"Barrymore",
   showFullName:function () {
     console.log (this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
   }
};
showFullName();
window.showFullName();
