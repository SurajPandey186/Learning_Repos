Following are some of optimization techniques:-

1. Memoization techniques:- 

   1. React.memo
   2. React.useMemo
   3. React.useCallback
   
2. Try to use your leaf level children or child components as much as memoised,
   but only if your child do not need frequent updates, if it is un-necessarily 
   rendering then first check is there an effect that is causing it, if this not
   and it is being due to some parent changes then go head and use it.

3. Stop Excess Reconciliations
   1. Passing down unnecessary props
      <Component {...rest} />
   2. Object literal defined in render 
      <Component style={{margin: 0}} />
   3. Anonymouns functions defined in render
      <Component onChange={()=> this.onChange()} />

4. New Hooks
   1. useTransition
   2. useDeferredValue
