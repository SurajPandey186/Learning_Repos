1. A container orchestration tool.

2. Components of Kubernetes
    1. Pod
    2. Service
    3. Configmap
    4. Secret 
 
3. Process needs to installed on Worker Nodes :-
    1. kubelet
    2. kube-proxy

4. Master server have following 4 process :-
    1. Api Server 
       Gateway for the cluster

    2. Scheduler
       A process that helps in scheduling a new pod.

    3. Controller manager
       A process that detects the changes in the state of the cluster
       and try to recover to the stable state asap.

       For example: When ever a pod dies in the worker node, it detects
       that and try to recover died pod asap.  

    4. etcd 
       The brain of the cluster. Contains complete cluster state information.

5. Master processes, like worker process can also be many in a cluster, then in   that
   case those multiple masters are load balanced.

6. Master process use less resource beacuse of less load of the work, then compare to worker processs.

7. Kubectl is a client for communicating with K8s Cluster.

8. Deployment component is an abstraction over the pod in the Cluster.   

9. TargetPort of service should always match with ContainersPort of Deployment.

10. T	o describe any component in k8s Cluster, then run the following command :- 
    kubectl describe <COMPONENT> <COMPONENT_NAME>;

11. To get the details of the pod with including ip
     kubectl get pod -o wide

12. A service can be made external service with the following uses:- 
    1. Add type: LoadBalancer
    2. Adding node port like nodePort: 300000 [30000-32000]
