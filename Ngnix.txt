  B. Points
     
	 1. HTTP Verbs details
        
        B1. - GET Method
            
            1. A get request is always followed by the request uri.
            2. Conditional Requests
               
               The If-Modified-Since request HTTP header makes the request conditional: the server sends back the requested resource, 
			   with a 200 status, only if it has been last modified after the given date. If the resource has not been modified since, 
			   the response is a 304 without any body; the Last-Modified response header of a previous request contains the date of last 
			   modification. Unlike If-Unmodified-Since, If-Modified-Since can only be used with a GET or HEAD.			   
	 
	        3. Partial Requests

               Partial request is like if we are asking for big files then only some bytes of the requested files is being sent to the client.
               
			   Example:- This will be the case when you are vedio streaming a particular vedio file
